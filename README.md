# Student-Portal-UOL
This project is build using JSF. It is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces. JavaServer Faces is a standardized display technology, which was formalized in a specification through the Java Community Process. We use xHTML and CSS for frontend look and to organize the elements properly. Through XHTML we can not only use simple html tags but including libraries for example: h,: f, :c, :a we can do a lot. For backend programming I use Java classes to support functions and variables and connect all the Data through jdbc to MySQL database to store data dynamically and this reuires JSF as it has been designed with Rapid Application Development RAD. It has excellent community support as well as a great suite of 3rd party components e.g. PrimeFaces. However, there are still many detailed tasks involved in building JSF-based applications that are required across all the phases of the standard software development lifecycle SDLC. Some of these tasks are already included in JSF standard implementation, whereas others are supported by the 3rd party.

Problem Statement:
JavaServer Faces JSF is the current front-end technology for building web-based applications
in the Java Enterprise Edition platform JavaEE and in this pandemic covid-19 in most of the
countries situation is worst so government implemented lockdown so people require platform
to where they can find all the paid and free courses whether it is on software development or
business administration. To done this work I choose java server faces as it is considered the
easiest approach for implementing the prototype. However, this approach limits the JSF to be
fully dependent on the currently available components and themes.
JSF has been designed to include many of the needed technical requirements for modern web- applications to achieve a RAD approach, including:
• MVC through views and managed beans.
• Automatic binding between user-interface components and server-side counterparts using
expression language
• Built-in template engine (Facelets)
• Ready-made user-interface components.
• Built-in validation for input fields(Validators)
• AJAX support
 
Proposed Solution:
For this current situation I developed a website titled as Student portal where people all around
the world can find paid and free courses on different types of subjects as people requires this
badly in lockdown situation as they require to study courses this to build their skills on different
subjects but they can’t find proper platform. so it developed a web application which is based
on Java server faces to fulfill this requirement and why do I use java for including development
environment setup and preparation, prototype and design, development and troubleshooting,
and performance because In such applications, however, there was a lot of technical
requirements that were time-consuming and manually handled by the application developers,
such as: MVC, binding i.e. linking the user interface input components to server-side fields,
input validation, templating i.e. encapsulation of UI design layout and views, pages navigation
and workflow, composite UI components, among others. This has resulted in many frameworks
and API’s created by 3rd party organizations, communities, and vendors to solve such issues.
So I decided to use JSF to go with a new web-technology from the ground-up, to include all
the required features that became mandatory for most web applications, along with modernized
concepts of component-based and event-driven web applications, and that was JSF 2.2 and I
uses Glass fish server to connect with database.
