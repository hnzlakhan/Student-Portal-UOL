# Student-Portal-UOL
This project is build using JSF. It is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces. JavaServer Faces is a standardized display technology, which was formalized in a specification through the Java Community Process. We use xHTML and CSS for frontend look and to organize the elements properly. Through XHTML we can not only use simple html tags but including libraries for example: h,: f, :c, :a we can do a lot. For backend programming I use Java classes to support functions and variables and connect all the Data through jdbc to MySQL database to store data dynamically and this reuires JSF as it has been designed with Rapid Application Development RAD. It has excellent community support as well as a great suite of 3rd party components e.g. PrimeFaces. However, there are still many detailed tasks involved in building JSF-based applications that are required across all the phases of the standard software development lifecycle SDLC. Some of these tasks are already included in JSF standard implementation, whereas others are supported by the 3rd party.
